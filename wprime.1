.SH NAME
wprime \- determine if 
.I n 
in
.I N
is a prime, when
.I n
!= 0.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wprime
\-dhd  [ -b n]

.B wprime
[
.B \-vsm
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B wprime
program allow for computing if a natural number is a prime by utilzing Wilsom's theorem.

wprime has a time complexity of Î¸(n) = T(n-1). Which is because for each n,
Wilsom' theorem stats that p is prime if (p-1)! === 0modp. So the number of multiplication instruction is proportional to p.

.SH OPTIONS

.\.SH 1. COMMAND-LINE Options
.TP
.B \-b
Set number base for the input digit, default is 10. 
.TP
.B \-o
Sets number base to octacl which has the base 8.
.TP
.B \-v
Output version of the program and exit. 
.TP
.B \-H
Sets number base to hexadecimal which has the base 16.
.TP
.B \-h
Format the output in a human readable format.
.TP
.B \-d
Sets the number base to decimal which has the base 10.
.TP
.B \-m
Display the maximun number that is supported for determing if its a prime. 
.TP
.B \-s
Display the size of 
.B unsigned long long int
size in bits used for computing if its a prime or not.

.SH EXIT STATUS
If exist status is equal 0 than the program was exited successfully.


\#.SH EXAMPLES

\#wprime can take input from either from an argument or regular piping.

\#.B wprime
\#\-h 42
\#.TP
\#Will output in human readable for that 42 is not a prime number.
\#.TP
	
\#.B wprime
\#42 
\#.TP
\#Will output in boolean format. That is to say if 42 is prime, it output 1, if not 0. In this case 0.

\# echo "42" | wprime
\#.B wprime \-b
\#.TP
\#Will 
\#.TP
\#.B wprime \-v
\#.TP
\#Output version of 
\#.B wprime

.SH NOTES
Because the C compiler has a limit size for the 
.B unsigned long long int
data in bits. Thus there is a limit of how big prime number can be used. wprime uses 
.B unsigned long long int
, Which is at least 64-bits, depending of what platform. That is to say 1.8446744e+19 in base 10. So the biggest prime possible to compute is as followed.
2^(n/2) - 1, where n is the biggest integer in number of bits supported. This is an approximated value which has yet to be proven. So for a 64-bits integer, it would give 4294967295.
